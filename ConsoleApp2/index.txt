Bloom Filter is a data structure that can do this job. 
It is mainly a spaced optimized version of hashing where we may have false positives. 
The idea is to not store the actual key rather store only hash values. 
It is mainly a probabilistic and space optimized hashing where less than 10 bits per key are required for a 1% false positive probability 
and is not dependent on the size of individual keys.

What is Bloom Filter?

A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. 
For example, checking availability of username is set membership problem, where the set is the list of all registered username. 
The price we pay for efficiency is that it is probabilistic in nature that means, there might be some False Positive results.
False positive means, it might tell that given username is already taken but actually it’s not.


Interesting Properties of Bloom Filters  

    Unlike a standard hash table, a Bloom filter of a fixed size can represent a set with an arbitrarily large number of elements.
    Adding an element never fails. 
            However, the false positive rate increases steadily as elements are added until all bits in the filter are set to 1, 
            at which point all queries yield a positive result.
    Bloom filters never generate false negative result, i.e., telling you that a username doesn’t exist when it actually exists.
    Deleting elements from filter is not possible because, 
            if we delete a single element by clearing bits at indices generated by k hash functions, 
            it might cause deletion of few other elements. 
            Example – if we delete “geeks” (in given example below) by clearing bit at 1, 4 and 7, we might end up deleting “nerd” also 
            Because bit at index 4 becomes 0 and bloom filter claims that “nerd” is not present.
